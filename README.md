# JS Strict mode by using "use strict" 


ECMAScript 5 introduced "use strict"   to solve some common problems in JS.  One of te most important problem  is  not to  use the word var to declare a variable. By using  "use strict" an error  will be thrown if  the word var  is not  being used  in the scope.

The most common problem that can be solved by using  "use strict" are:

 * Using a variable without declaring it
 * No duplicate arguments
 * Future reserved keywords
 * File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files
 * Variable declared inside an eval function
 * Eliminates 'this' coercion
 * Errors for immutables



Depending of  which error has been done, the error  will be shown  when the js file  is loaded or  when  the function with the error is called.
